> **The Socratic AI tutor that helps students build critical thinking skills, rather than bypassing them.**

## 💡 The Problem

In the age of Generative AI, students face a dilemma:

1.  **Struggle alone** at 2 AM with no feedback.
2.  **Use ChatGPT** and risk academic dishonesty while stunting their own learning.

Writing centers are great, but they aren't scalable or available 24/7. Students need a tool that acts as a **coach**, not a ghostwriter.

## 🚀 The Solution: Inline

Inline is a writing assistant designed for **Academic Safety** and **Skill Growth**. unlike standard AI tools that auto-complete your sentences, Inline uses **Socratic Inquiry** to:

-   Identify weak logic and gaps in argumentation.
-   Ask probing questions to spark deeper thinking.
-   Provide structural feedback without generating the text for you.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **🛡️ 100% Plagiarism Free:** The AI never writes the essay for you. It only analyzes and questions.
-   **🧠 Socratic Logic Engine:** Detects logical fallacies and weak claims, then prompts the user to strengthen them.
-   **⚡ Instant Formatting:** seamless copy-paste handling for raw text or document uploads.
-   **🔒 Private Environment:** A safe space to fail and iterate before submitting to a professor.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** React (Vite) for high-performance rendering.
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive "Swiss Design" aesthetic.
-   **Icons:** Lucide React for consistent visual language.
-   **Deployment:** Vercel (Demo) / Azure (Planned).
