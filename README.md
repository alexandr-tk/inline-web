## About The Project

**Inline** is a writing tutor designed to solve the "2 AM Struggle" without compromising academic integrity. Unlike generative models that replace the student's voice, Inline acts as a rigorous logic checker that strengthens arguments through **Socratic inquiry**.

We solve two critical problems in the academic workflow:
1.  **The Blank Page Fear:** Providing the initial nudge to get momentum going without auto-completing the work.
2.  **Honest Feedback:** Offering rigorous, judgment-free critique on logic gaps and evidence strength before the assignment is submitted.

The project is developed in partnership with research faculty at **Lafayette College** and is currently in the **Data Collection & Annotation** phase.

## Philosophy

**"Generative models replace your voice. Inline strengthens it."**

We are building the anti-thesis to ChatGPT for education. Our system is architected to ensure 100% plagiarism-free output by refusing to generate text for the user.

| Feature | Generative AI | Inline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Academic Safety** | High Risk (Flags as AI) | **100% Plagiarism Free** |
| **Skill Growth** | Stunts growth (Bypasses learning) | **Builds Critical Thinking** |
| **Feedback Style** | Auto-Completion | **Socratic Guidance** |
| **Primary Output** | Text Generation | **Deep Questions** |

## Methodology

Generic AI is trained on the open internet, prioritizing statistical probability. Inline is trained on **graded coursework** and **faculty critiques**, prioritizing logical depth.

### 1. Expert-Level Logic
Our critique patterns are sourced from rigorous faculty feedback standards used at leading research institutions. We calibrate our models to evaluate the strength of ideas, not just grammar.

### 2. The Socratic Loop
Instead of fixing errors silently, the system employs a three-step cognitive loop:
* **Upload:** The system ingests the draft.
* **Inquiry:** The AI identifies weak arguments and asks deeply probing questions (e.g., *"What specific evidence supports this assertion?"*).
* **Refine:** The student rewrites the argument. The AI checks the logic again.
